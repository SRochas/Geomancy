# Purpose
This repository tracks changes to an Oblivion mod I'm creating called Geomancy. Oblivion mods are exported by the Oblivion Construction Set as an `.esp` file. Since this file is machine-readable, it is not easy to track changes made to the mod over time. This leads easily to problems such as ["dirty mods"](https://cs.uesp.net/wiki/TES4Edit/Mod_cleaning_tutorial_with_TES4Edit) which are cleaned either through the Construction Set, or, much more easily, with tools like [TES4Edit](https://github.com/TES5Edit).

## Problem with TES4Edit
The problem with TES4Edit is that it largely exists as a GUI tool. It does allow for visualization of plugin diffs, but these changes are not easily viewable from version control tools such as Git. To address this issue, I am using another tool called [Spriggit CLI](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Spriggit) by [Noggog](https://github.com/Noggog). This CLI takes an .esp file (Oblivion mod file) and destructures it into a visual set of nested folders so changes can be more easily seen from version control tools reducing the common problem of "dirty mods".

# What is Geomancy? üçÉ
Geomancy is a new form of Wind Magic I'll be creating a mod for in Oblivion. Little is yet known about this ancient form of magic, but I will keep my README up-to-date with any discoveries of my findings.

## Geomancy Gust Mod - Teaser
I have released a teaser for my first spell in the series: Gust.
