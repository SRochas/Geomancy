# Purpose
This repository is used to track version changes on an Oblivion mod I'm creating called Geomancy.

# Structure
To version control changes made to the mod, I am using [Spriggit CLI](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Spriggit) by [Noggog](https://github.com/Noggog). This library provides a CLI for destructuring .esp files into visible changes. The goal in destructuring these .esp files is to visualize changes for version control while developing the Geomancy mod.

# What is Geomancy?
Geomancy is a new form of magic I'll be creating as part of my Geomancy mod. I will do my best to keep this README up-to-date with the latest updates in this mod, so stay tuned!

## Geomancy Gust Mod - Teaser
I have released a teaser for my first spell in the series: Gust.
